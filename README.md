# MinimalCadQuery

CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python module for constructing parametric 3D CAD models. Originally created by dcowden, it is now being developed under the CadQuery organization.

MinimalCadQuery is a fork of CadQuery, offering a minimal implementation with the OCP core.

Its primary objectives include:

1. Understanding CadQueryâ€™s source code.
2. Exploring new ideas.
3. Experimenting with adaptation to other CAD kernels.
